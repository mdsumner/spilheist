Two longlat arrays from ESRI software, with lon, lat, X, Y columns in CSV (gzipped).  Two versions



* grid1964.csv.gz - with side dimension 1964
* grid214.csv.gz - with side dimension 214

Neither grid is *complete*, there are missing values in the corners (at least) - so use in a grid context requires completing the X, Y cases.
